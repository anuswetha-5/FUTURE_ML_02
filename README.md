🎫 Support Ticket Classification & Prioritization System
🚀 Project Overview

Modern customer support teams receive thousands of tickets daily.
Manual triaging leads to delays, inefficiencies, and poor customer experience.

This project builds an end-to-end NLP-powered Machine Learning system that automatically:

🏷️ Classifies tickets into categories (e.g., Technical Issue, Billing, Refund)

🚨 Assigns priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

⚡ Enables instant routing of urgent cases

The goal: Reduce response time, eliminate manual sorting, and improve operational efficiency.

    1️⃣ Text Preprocessing

Incoming raw tickets are cleaned using:

    Lowercasing

    Punctuation removal

    Stopword removal

    Lemmatization (running → run)

This ensures consistent and meaningful feature extraction.

2️⃣ Feature Engineering — TF-IDF

We use TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into high-dimensional numerical vectors.

Why TF-IDF?

    Captures word importance

    Handles large vocabularies efficiently

    Works extremely well for classical ML text models

🤖 Machine Learning Models
🏷️ Ticket Category Model

    Algorithm: Logistic Regression

    Why Logistic Regression?

    Fast and computationally efficient

    Highly effective for multi-class text classification

    Performs well with sparse TF-IDF vectors

    Interpretable coefficients

🚨 Ticket Priority Model

    Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

    Why Random Forest?

    Captures nonlinear keyword interactions

    Handles complex decision boundaries

    Reduces overfitting through ensemble learning

    Robust for real-world noisy text data

📊 Model Evaluation

    We evaluated the models using:

    Accuracy – Overall correctness

    Precision – Reduces false alarms

    Recall – Ensures critical tickets are not missed

    F1-Score – Balance of precision and recall

    Confusion Matrix – Visual breakdown of classification performance

📌 Detailed classification reports and confusion matrices are available in:

💡 Business Impact

Integrating this system into a SaaS or enterprise support workflow enables:

⚡ Faster Escalations

Critical tickets are immediately flagged and routed.

📉 Reduced Backlog

Agents receive pre-sorted queues.

📈 Higher Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

Correct routing reduces resolution time.

💰 Operational Cost Reduction

Less manual triaging = higher productivity.
